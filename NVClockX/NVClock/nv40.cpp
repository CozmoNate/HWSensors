/*
/ The original NV40 gpu was used as the base for 6800LE/6800NU/6800GT/6800Ultra
/ GPUs. The difference between all these models lie in the amount of enabled
/ pixel/vertex pipelines and clockspeeds. For instance the 6800LE ships with 8
/ pixel pipelines while the 6800GT ships with 16 of those. Right after production
/ all GPUs are tested, if all pipelines work and they run at high clocks they
/ are called Ultra or if pipes are broken they are called 6800NU(12p) or 6800LE(8p).
/ Further in some cases 'good' GPUs can be rebranded too if there's a shortage of
/ 6800NU/6800LE GPUs. The key to this rebranding is register 0x1540 which contains
/ the enabled pixel/vertex pipelines. Depending on the GPU architecture a bit can
/ correspond to a single vertex shader or to a block containing two or four
/ pixel pipelines.
/
/ We now define some words coming from Rivatuner as people are familiar with those.
/ A 'good' GPU for which pipelines are disabled just to get enough lowend models
/ is said to contain 'Software masked units'. In this case the videobios initializes
/ 0x1540 with a value that locks out some units.
/ GPUs which didn't pass the hardware quality testing contain 'Hardware masked units'.
/ In this case the bios initializes 0x1540 with a value that enables all pipelines.
/ A certain (read-only) register (0xc010) contains a mask of units to disable by default.
/ The bios loads this value into another register (0xc020) at startup. The value from
/ 0xc020 is then used by the drivers to disable units in 0x1540. For example by clearing this
/ register before the drivers are loaded, you can prevent masks from being disabled.

/ 1540 units_cfg (rw) second byte contains vertex configuration and first byte pipeline
/ c010 default_mask (r) pixel pipelines start at +22, while vertex start at +16 (is this correct for all cards?)
/ c020 active_mask (rw)
/ c024/c028/c02c are being set to 0, why? (they correspond to c014/c018/c01c)
/
/ Below are supported pipeline configurations on various types of cards. Not sure
/ if everything is fully correct though:
/ - NV40 0x3f0f 6800 cards
/ - NV41 0x1f07 6800 pci-e (is this correct?)
/ - NV43 0x0703 6200/6600 cards
/ - NV44 0x0703 6200(Go)/Turbocache cards
/ - NV46 0x0703 7300 (is this correct?)
/ - NV47/NV49 0xff3f 7800/7900 cards
/ - NV4B 0x1f0f 7600
