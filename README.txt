Open source SMC device driver/emulator (FakeSMC) by netkas (http://netkas.org/) with 
hardware monitoring plugins.

IMPORTANT: Do not install DRIVERS on real mac! This even may work but you are doing
it at your own risk. On the other side HWMonitor.app is fully compatible with Macs 
so you can still use it to monitor hardware sensors provided by SMC.
